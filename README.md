# Lead.AI WhatsApp Agent

A WhatsApp automation agent that answers common questions, qualifies leads, and routes high-value conversations to humans.

## Product Status

Prototype / In Development

This repository is public and suitable for product planning, documentation review, and future implementation. It should not be described as production-ready until working code, tests, deployment steps, and security controls are in place.

## Problem Solved

Businesses miss WhatsApp leads and manually answer repetitive questions.

## Target Users

- Local service businesses
- Retail stores
- Appointment-based businesses
- Support teams
- Agencies

## Key Features

- WhatsApp message handling
- Lead qualification
- FAQ responses
- Booking intent detection
- Business hours handling
- Escalation to human
- CRM-ready lead storage
- Twilio integration placeholder

## Tech Stack

- FastAPI
- Twilio
- OpenAI API
- Firebase or PostgreSQL

## Architecture Overview

The intended architecture separates product UI, backend workflows, AI orchestration, data storage, integrations, and operational controls.

Core layers:

- User experience layer for business users and administrators.
- API or service layer for validation, workflow execution, and integrations.
- AI layer for prompts, scoring, summaries, recommendations, or decision support.
- Data layer for leads, conversations, reports, scores, configuration, or audit records.
- Security layer for authentication, authorization, privacy, logging, and secret management.

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the detailed design direction.

## Setup Instructions

There is no complete runnable application in this repository yet unless implementation files have been added after this documentation pass.

Recommended future setup pattern:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# install project dependencies after the stack is implemented
# run the local development server after package scripts are added
```

When code is added, update this section with exact install, development, test, lint, and build commands.

## Environment Variables

Configuration is documented in [.env.example](.env.example). Use placeholder names only in public files. Never commit real `.env` files, API keys, access tokens, private credentials, customer exports, or private datasets.

## Usage Flow

1. Customer sends a WhatsApp message to the business.
2. Webhook verifies the message and routes it to the AI workflow.
3. The agent answers FAQs, qualifies intent, and detects booking needs.
4. Sensitive or high-value conversations are escalated to a human.

See [User Flow](docs/USER_FLOW.md) for more detail.

## Screenshots And Demo

Screenshots, demo links, and videos will be added after a working demo exists.

Suggested public assets:

- Product dashboard screenshot.
- Primary workflow screenshot.
- Short demo video or GIF.
- Deployment or live demo link, if available.

## Roadmap

See [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [MVP Plan](docs/MVP_PLAN.md).

Immediate next step: Implement webhook verification and a simple qualification conversation flow.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit secrets or private customer data.
- Validate user input before storage, scoring, AI processing, or external API calls.
- Avoid logging personally identifiable information.
- Add authentication and authorization before handling protected business data.

See [Security](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Responsible AI Notes

- Keep AI limitations visible to users and reviewers.
- Avoid unsupported claims about accuracy or reliability.
- Provide human review or handoff for sensitive, uncertain, or high-impact outcomes.
- Prefer explainable outputs for scores, recommendations, and risk signals.
